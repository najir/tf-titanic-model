# Description

Following tutorial provided by: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimator/linear
This just serves as a point of practice with pandas, matplotlib, and tensorflow while using the provided tutorial as a guide on how to use tensorflow.

- Creating a linear regression model based on Titanic dataset
- Importing data via pandas to clean up and seperate information
- Use numpy to efficiently process and manipulate arrays, vectors, and matrices
- Using matplotlib to visualize some of the data and output information
    - Creating and visualizing a lot of info on the dataset before testing the model
    - Death statistics based on sex
    - Grouping passengers by age and seperately by class as well
    - creating several graph representations of models
- Tensorflow for the regression model and actual algorithm
    - Setting up featured columns & input function for Linear Classification
    - training on main dataset
    - predicting probabilities with trained model and evaluating data
